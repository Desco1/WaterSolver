# WaterSolver
A simple Water Board solver.

Some variants are very wrong! No need to report this...\
For now this is it. Might update the mod by being able to save your own solutions or fix the wrong ones, but ETA unknown.

## Usage
Download the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/Desco1/WaterSolver/releases) or build it yourself.\
Grab the .jar and put it in your .minecraft/mods folder, as you would with any other mod.\
It, sadly, requires Essential.

## Credits
- [DSM](https://github.com/bowser0000/SkyblockMod/) for most of the code of room detection.
- [Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod/) for the rendering and part of the actual solver.
- derek1984 for the actual solutions and Jade for bringing them to my attention.\

If you are using this mod as reference to make your own solver, credit this page, the other code and people that made this possible.
